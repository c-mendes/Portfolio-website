			<h1>Project: Expert App</h1>
			<p>Expert app is the result of my project with Careerfoundry UX design program.</p>
			<p>As part of the immersion part of the program, students were tasked to complete an app that enables anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with an expert in virtually any field.</p>
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uiwy68jerCw0IDr7ye30FjLGcNKFSYGB/view">Project brief with more details can be found here.</a>

				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p><b>What problems am I trying to solve?</b></p>
				<p>Using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K8nClcV0nTE-cOZP3H37MfMpyGS0dQf9/view">Double Diamond Strategy</a> it was possible to identify a series of possible problems/hypotheses that the idea of this app would aim to solve. The
				below problem statement was later refined and identified:</p>
					<div class="">
						<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
						<p>HR students need a simple and easy way to network, ask questions and get mentorship to break the gap between student-life to work-life. They need an environment that is welcoming, 
						private (no sensitive data is shared online), and where quick and reliable feedback is key. They also want to ensure cultural bias and geographic differences don’t influence the credibility 
						of the interactions provided by professionals.</p>
						<p>We will know this to be true when we see increased user adoption by HR students of this app; users ranking professionals’ answers and professionals actively registering and engaging with
						students by sharing their experiences and knowledge.</p>
					</div>

				<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<p>Expert app is a question-and-answer app that aims to bridge the gap between HR students/career changers who are taking their first steps into HR. The app allows users to browse and research HR 
					professionals based on their location, level of experience and knowledge of HR policies. Through the app, users can easily connect with professionals, asking questions and requesting video/audio 
					conversations, empowering their network and preparing them for their chosen careers.</p>

				<h2>1. Research</h2>
					<div class="">
						<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
						<p>To better understand the app's offering and singularities a competitive analysis was done across 2 competitors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>JustAnswer</li>
							<li>Quora</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Competitor analysis addressed each competitor's key objectives; overall strategy; market advantages and profile and a SWOT profile analysis. A UX analysis has also been conducted looking into 
						each competitor's elements such as usability,layout, navigation structure, compatibility, differentiation and calls to action.</p>
						<p>The complete competitor's analysis conducted can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv3_hse3zva83HFMIiQZ9MSHfdFI3YYm/view">here</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="">
						<h3>User survey's & User interviews (affinity mapping):</h3>
						<p>2 sets of surveys have been conducted:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0c5fBAE3luD4hqf6QDpsxUT3hhvV1SY/view">Student-focused survey</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1taiPhqXPku4-5X8dE9-a1x5XXYuQULvb/view">Professionals-focused survey</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Interviews were also broken down by Students vs HR professionals aiming to understand the different expectations of each potential user.</p>
						<p>User surveys and interview key findings were initially collected in Miro boards to inform the overall app research. Analysis of data included affinity mapping of both survey and interviews conducted.</p>
						<p>Affinity maps and further key findings can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhzdjHOMr1WGVkjQzcjS0HyQRpW0dNFt/view">here</a>.</p>

						</picture>
						
						<h3>Mental models; User Journeys and User flows:</h3>
						<p>Sub sequential Mental models and User Journeys for specific goals and expectations of the app were conducted, based on the original research, to understand how each user would navigate the app. 
						One example can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJI9GiSy67I4_4Tbbvol909kTlCotkG_/view">here</a>.</p>
						<p>Task analysis and user flows were also identified for the mental models and user journeys developed above. One example can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkC9-j2KRwDsIiOQYxnZVgxDac8f69bj/view">here</a>.</p>
						<p>Also part of the research stage, a sitemap was developed for the app, and through the use of open-card sorting technique changes to the sitemap were explored, iterating on the original navigation. 
						A before and after of the sitemap can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176Xudh9bZIJbiOjYk44q5F3BMpUTuB4r/view">here</a>, illustrating the iterations and process conducted to achieve it.</p>

				<h2>3. Design</h2>
					<div class="">
						<h3>Paper sketches / Low-fidelity wireframes & Mid-fidelity wireframes:</h3>
						<p>Design stages were initiated with the development of paper sketches/low-fidelity wireframes and sequential iteration into mid-fidelity wireframes using whimsical.com.</p>
						<p>The 2 examples illustrated below, are low/mid fidelity wireframes developed form the above mentioned task analysis/user flow actions that users can execute through the app:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>3.1. Browsing experts profiles</li>
							<li>3.2. Sending a message to an expert</a></li>

						<p>Further testing has also been conducted through A/B preference testing methods, highlighting some extra edits to specific screens.</p>
					</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="container">
				<h2>5. Visual Design</h2>
					<div class="">
						<h3>Visual design principles & Accessibility design:</h3>
						<p>The app design was revisited following the 3 Principles of Design and Gestalt Properties/Laws of grouping. Most screens were considered under these principles in order to achieve symmetry and 
						ease of use.</p>
						<p>Similarly, screens were checked for accessibility, lifting up and correcting any immediate issues that could be posed for specific audiences and minimizing poor app usage/adoption by specific 
						audiences.</p>
					
						<h3>Peer collaboration:</h3>
						<p>Taking advantage of Careerfoundry network, the app final prototype was presented to designers and design students, who provided valuable insight and identified areas of improvement to the app. 
						These were implemented and corrected.</p>
						
						<h3>Language Design Systems:</h3>
						<p>When preparing deliverables for production, a Language Design System, identifying Expert app visual language has been created, highlighting usage of colour, components (images and text) for the app.</p>
						<p>A copy of the final Language Design System document can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Yw1gFxX1TCac-h1gI0ph5GCs1ySUzPy/view">here</a>.</p>

					<h2>Learnings</h2>
					<p>Throughout this exercise, I was able to learn all stages of a UX design project. Although some areas were familiar to me, such as research and persona development, these were done slightly differently 
					from my past experience and a lot of emphases was placed on how a user interacts with the design.</p>
					<p>I've also learned how to use systems that I haven't used before, such as Adobe XD; Figma; Whimsical and other tools that assisted me throughout my research. Looking out for good tutorials was the most 
					difficult part of the project as I had to familiarize myself with UX terminology and understand who to look out for in terms of inspiration and advice.</p>
					<p>Overall it was a great experience, and one I'm now able to cross with my marketing career, building up on new products and campaigns.</p>
