					<p> Project for Careerfoundry UX design program. An app that enables anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with an expert in virtually any field.
						Check out the app's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uiwy68jerCw0IDr7ye30FjLGcNKFSYGB/view">project brief</a>.</p>

				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p>Using the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K8nClcV0nTE-cOZP3H37MfMpyGS0dQf9/view">Double Diamond Strategy</a> it was possible to identify a series of possible problems/hypotheses that the idea of this app would aim to solve. The
				below problem statement was later refined and identified:</p>
					<div class="blockquote">
						<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
						<p>HR students need a simple and easy way to network, ask questions and get mentorship to break the gap between student-life to work-life. They need an environment that is welcoming,
						private (no sensitive data is shared online), and where quick and reliable feedback is key. They also want to ensure cultural bias and geographic differences don’t influence the credibility
						of the interactions provided by professionals.</p>
						<p>We will know this to be true when we see increased user adoption by HR students of this app; users ranking professionals’ answers and professionals actively registering and engaging with
						students by sharing their experiences and knowledge.</p>
					</div>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="section">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<p>Expert app allows users to browse and research HR professionals based on their location, level of experience and knowledge of HR policies.</p>
					<p>Through the app, users can easily connect with professionals, asking questions and requesting video/audio conversations, empowering their network and preparing them for their chosen careers.</p>
					<p><b>A high-fidelity clickable prototype for the app can be accessed <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/860eff93-3274-4fb8-bc0c-e32e03e66030-d35d/?fullscreen">here</a>.</b></p>

						<h3>1. Research:</h3>
						<p>To better understand the app's offering and singularities a competitive analysis was done across 2 competitors:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>JustAnswer</li>
								<li>Quora</li>
							</ul>
						<p>The complete competitor's analysis conducted can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv3_hse3zva83HFMIiQZ9MSHfdFI3YYm/view">here</a>.</p>
					
						<p>2 sets of user surveys have also been conducted:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0c5fBAE3luD4hqf6QDpsxUT3hhvV1SY/view">Student-focused survey</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1taiPhqXPku4-5X8dE9-a1x5XXYuQULvb/view">Professionals-focused survey</a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>User interviews were also conducted and broken down by Students vs HR professionals aiming to understand the different expectations of each potential user.</p>
							<p>User surveys and interview key findings were initially collected in Miro boards to inform the overall app research. Analysis of data included affinity mapping of both survey and interviews conducted.</p>
							<p>Affinity maps and further key findings can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhzdjHOMr1WGVkjQzcjS0HyQRpW0dNFt/view">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>2. Synthesize</h3>
							<p>Using the information gathered during research, 3 design personas were identified and developed.</p>
								<h4>User personas:</h4>

									</picture>

								<h4>Mental models; User Journeys and User flows:</h4>
									<p>Sub sequential Mental models and User Journeys for specific goals and expectations of the app were conducted, based on the original research, to understand how each user would navigate the app.
									One example can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJI9GiSy67I4_4Tbbvol909kTlCotkG_/view">here</a>.</p>
									<p>Task analysis and user flows were also identified for the mental models and user journeys developed above. One example can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkC9-j2KRwDsIiOQYxnZVgxDac8f69bj/view">here</a>.</p>
									<p>Also part of the research stage, a sitemap was developed for the app, and through the use of open-card sorting technique changes to the sitemap were explored, iterating on the original navigation.
									A before and after of the sitemap can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176Xudh9bZIJbiOjYk44q5F3BMpUTuB4r/view">here</a>, illustrating the iterations and process conducted to achieve it.</p>

						<h3>3. Design</h3>
							<h4>Paper sketches / Low-fidelity wireframes & Mid-fidelity wireframes:</h4>
								<p>Design stages were initiated with the development of paper sketches/low-fidelity wireframes and sequential iteration into mid-fidelity wireframes using whimsical.com.</p>
								<p>The 2 examples illustrated below, are low/mid fidelity wireframes developed form the above mentioned task analysis/user flow actions that users can execute through the app:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>3.1. Browsing experts profiles</li>
									<li>3.2. Sending a message to an expert</a></li>
								</ul>
							
								<p><b>3.1. Browsing expert profiles</b></p>

							<h4>High-fidelity prototypes:</h4>
								<p>High-fidelity versions of the low/mid fidelity prototypes were then created. A high fidelity clickable prototype was also created for user testing.</p>

						<h3>4. User Testing</h2>
					
							<h4>Usability testing plan:</h4>
								<p>Using the high-fidelity prototype above, usability tests were conducted. A plan for the Expert app usability testing, including script for tests conducted can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nh2yaR4RvUpgNXmrVifuhNUGI_hey2DV/view">here</a>.</p>

							<h4>Usability testing report:</h4>
								<p>An affinity map using the recordings from tests was conducted to group test results into actionable takeaway.</p>

							<p>The rainbow spreadsheet model was also used to organise data into actionable information:</p>

							<p>A final detailed report was then put together highlighting all results from user testing and updates to the app. Access to the final report available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FXtwCwpwetpLsOFk5HSAzVUSArK2MgO8/view">here</a>.</p>
							<p>Further testing has also been conducted through A/B preference testing methods, highlighting some extra edits to specific screens.</p>

						<h3>5. Visual Design</h3>
							<h4>Visual design principles & Accessibility design:</h4>
								<p>The app design was revisited following the 3 Principles of Design and Gestalt Properties/Laws of grouping. Most screens were considered under these principles in order to achieve symmetry and ease of use.</p>
								<p>Similarly, screens were checked for accessibility, lifting up and correcting any immediate issues that could be posed for specific audiences and minimizing poor app usage/adoption by specific audiences.</p>

							<h4>Peer collaboration:</h4>
								<p>Taking advantage of Careerfoundry network, the app final prototype was presented to designers and design students, who provided valuable insight and identified areas of improvement to the app. These were implemented and corrected.</p>

							<h4>Language Design Systems:</h4>
								<p>When preparing deliverables for production, a Language Design System, identifying Expert app visual language has been created, highlighting usage of colour, components (images and text) for the app.</p>
								<p>A copy of the final Language Design System document can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Yw1gFxX1TCac-h1gI0ph5GCs1ySUzPy/view">here</a>.</p>

					<h2>Learnings</h2>
					<p>Throughout this exercise, I was able to learn all stages of a UX design project. Although some areas were familiar to me, such as research and persona development, these were done slightly differently
					from my past experience and a lot of emphases was placed on how a user interacts with the design.</p>
					<p>I've also learned how to use systems that I haven't used before, such as Adobe XD; Figma; Whimsical and other tools that assisted me throughout my research. Looking out for good tutorials was the most
					difficult part of the project as I had to familiarize myself with UX terminology and understand who to look out for in terms of inspiration and advice.</p>
					<p>Overall it was a great experience, and one I'm now able to cross with my marketing career, building up on new products and campaigns.</p>
