					<p> Vocab app is the result of my first project with <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/">CareerFoundry</a> UX design program.</p>
					<p>The app's research and low-fidelity prototyping is the result of the course Intro to UX Design. The project brief with more details can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8oDF1SC8gh0pbwHjmsUKCrerM_Z55_l/view">found here</a>.</p>

				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p>Who is the app for? To help professional immigrants build up their language skills in a foreign country.</p>
					<div class="blockquote">
						<h4>Problem statement</h4>
						<p>We will know this to be true when we see increased user adoption by professionals, who are also immigrants, of this app; actively registering and engaging with the app to increase their language knowledge.</p>
					</div>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="section">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<p>Vocab app is a vocabulary learning app that focuses on immigrants wanting to improve their language skills to develop in their roles. 
					The app focuses on areas such as grammar, listening skills and conversational skills. 
					Users can tailor the app to learn specific vocabulary to their professional life as well as their day-to-day lives.</p>

					<p>Throughout this project I took the role of UX researcher and designer, working through each stage of the project defined below. These stages included:</p>

					<div id="Research" class="tabcontent">
							<p><b>Competitive analysis:</b></p>
						<p>To better understand the app's offering and singularities a competitive analysis was done across 3 competitors: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Duolingo</li>
								<li>Bussu</li>
								<li>Pimsleur</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Competitor analysis addressed positive and negative attributes for areas such as: Download and installation; Sign up; Onboarding and App use.</p>
						<p>The complete competitor's analysis conducted can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhaaXOjMqaiExlBK-TDjOx8wwZIP8SCN/view">here</a>.</p>
					
						<p><b>User Interviews:</b></p>
						<p>Online user interviews were conducted with 4 participants who fit the app's main audience: immigrants working in a different country from their nationality, and wanting to improve their knowledge of the host country's language.</p>
						<p>Information from user interviews was collected in word documents, highlighting for each interviewee, demographic data as well as answers to the interview questions and significant quotes within their answers.</p>
						<p>Interview questions and detailed interviewee answers can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUtazctKTCx6AaYkALCoZ0z7JjSjnRog/view">here</a>.</p>

							<p>A clickable prototype (using Marvel app) was also developed for usability testing purposes. Clickable prototype can be accessed <a href="https://marvelapp.com/prototype/15g40724/screen/82297820">here</a>.</p>

					<div id="User Testing" class="tabcontent">
						<h4>Usability testing plan:</h4>
								<p>User testing started with the development of a usability testing plan, identifying areas such as the scope of the testing; schedule; equipment and metrics evaluated.</p>
								<p>From the plan, 4 direct tasks were identified as the main tasks to test. These were: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Task 1: Create an account</li>
										<li>Task 2: Set up a profile</li>
										<li>Task 3: Complete a "food" themed exercise</li>
										<li>Task 4: Complete a set of "food" themed exercises</li>
									</ul>
								<p>4 scenario tasks were also identified, these were:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Task 1: You have just signed into your app and want to attend a live class. Find the app feature that allows you to book live classes</li>
										<li>Task 2: You want to check your progress in the app. Locate the app feature that allows you to check how much you have learned so far</li>
										<li>Task 3: You have completed a set of ‘Food’ exercises and learned at least 3 new words. Add these words to your vocabulary folder</li>
										<li>Task 4: You have completed a set of ‘Food’ exercises and want to start a new set with a different theme. How do you do this?</li>
									</ul>

							<h4>Usability testing notes:</h4>
								<p>Notes from the tests conducted were gathered, per tester, in a word document, identifying: overall behaviour and frustrations; significant quotes and notes around the completion of each direct and scenario task.</p>
								<p>Further details on user testing plan; task breakdown and usability testing notes gathered can be accessed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rl3P0tK4lwObmwxYiCjJ39L8oF4XoJzs/view">here</a>.</p>

					<h2>Learnings</h2>
					<p>As the first-ever UX exercise, I've completed many of the learnings were down to the process itself and how to document information in a comprehensive way.</p>
					<p>I've also learned that initial assumptions can be easily overruled by tests and research. Through the development of user personas, I was able to validate, as well as refute, the initial assumptions on the need and applicability of this app. I was also able to identify other opportunities and tailor the existing app to fit within these opportunities. This is extremely important as it allowed me the insight to understand the app's relevance and applicability in the market.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, user testing was also an eye-opening exercise. It allowed me to look beyond my own perception of the app and understand that each user's understanding of the app's function is unique. This is key in terms of marketing a new product as the intent and overall experience can educate on the message and tone of a marketing campaign aimed at selling the Vocab app. </p>
